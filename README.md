# ENS DAO Governance

View and participate in executable proposals that govern the ENS Protocol and DAO.

The goal of this is not to provide any new functionality to the ecosystem, but rather exist as an open-source backup/alternative to existing governance tools.

See [indexer](./indexer/README.md) and [app](./app/README.md) for technical details.
